# Flower Drawing with Python Turtle

This project uses Python's `turtle` graphics library to draw a colorful flower with petals and leaves.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python flower_drawing.py
   ```

A window will open and draw the flower automatically.


## Requirements
